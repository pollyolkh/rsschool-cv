## About me

I am 27 years old, born in a small provincial town in the south of Russia. Most of the places where I worked were very boring and didn't allow me to develop. I quit my last job two years ago and devoted myself to photography. After a while I realized that I didn't want to make money from photography, I wanted to leave it as a hobby. Now I am in emigration, so I started looking for a sphere to earn money remotely. I like playing video games and I listen to music all the time. I am a very creative person, like to explore, so the prospect of becoming a front-end developer appealed to me!
